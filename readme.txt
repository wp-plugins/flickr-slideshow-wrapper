Including standard flickr slideshows into your blog. Call your Flickr slideshow by adding &lt;set&#95;id="XYZ"&gt; to your content. 

== Description ==
I didn't find any gallery which fulfilled my expectations. I don't need private pictures from flickr to be included to
my block, as once included they are not private anymore. That's why I wanted to use the standard functionality
of flickr to embed slideshows.

You can change the border, scrolling (yes/no), and width and height of the linked iframe under settings. I haven't found yet any parameter or hint to change the black background color. Please post me in case you have an advice and I'll change the coding accordingly.

== Installation ==
1. Upload 'flickr-slideshow-wrapper.php' to the '/wp-content/plugins/flickr-slideshow-wrapper' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Customize the settings under /Settings/FSSW/
4. Place &lt;set&#95;id="123213231231231"&gt; from your <a href="http://www.flickr.com" target="_blank">flickr.com</a> set into your content. Please pay attention to put the coding into the HTML section (HTML view). 
5. You can call as well a  <a href="http://www.slideflickr.com/" target="_blank">slideflickr.com</a> slideshow by putting the slideflickr id into &lt;slidef="XYZ"&gt;
6. With &lt;set&#95;tag="tag1, tag2, etc."&gt; your are able to compile your own tag-based set from flickr. Please refer to <a href="http://idgettr.com/" target="_blank">idgettr.com</a> to get the relevant information.
7. Please be informed that slideflickr needs the same width and height values you defined during creation of your slideshow on their webpage - otherwise you'll see an endless loading bar.
8. Ensure that you have put the code into your html section of your blog, not the visual one!
9. Have fun, and drop me a comment on <a href="http://www.ramgad.com" target="_blank">ramgad.com</a> if you have any comments, remarks, advices, wishes or if you're just happy.
For your convenience you can as well use [set_id=XYZ] and/or [slidef=XYZ]. This is even the better choice as the code is not destroyed by switching from visual to htmal view (I'm mainly using html view only ;-) ).
