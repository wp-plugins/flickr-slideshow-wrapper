Including standard flickr slideshow into your blog. Call your FlickrSlideshow by adding <set_id="XXX"> to your content. 

== Description ==

I did not find any gallery which fit fulfilled my expectations. I do not need private pictures from flickr to be included to
my block, as once included they are not private anymore. That's why I wanted to use the standard functionality
of flickr to embed slideshows.

You can change the border, scrolling (yes/no), and width and height of the linked iframe under settings.

== Installation ==
1. Upload `FlickrSlideShowWrapper.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Customize the settings under /Settings/FSSW/
4. Place `<set_id="123213231231231">` in your content
