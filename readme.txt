Including standard flickr slideshow into your blog. Call your FlickrSlideshow by adding <set_id="XXX"> to your content. 

== Description ==

I didn't find any gallery which fulfilled my expectations. I don't need private pictures from flickr to be included to
my block, as once included they are not private anymore. That's why I wanted to use the standard functionality
of flickr to embed slideshows.

You can change the border, scrolling (yes/no), and width and height of the linked iframe under settings. I haven't found yet any parameter or hint to change the black background color. Please post me in case you have an advice and I'll change the coding accordingly.

== Installation ==
1. Upload 'FlickrSlideShowWrapper.php' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Customize the settings under /Settings/FSSW/
4. Place '<set_id="123213231231231">' in your content. Please pay attention to put the coding into the HTML section (HTML view) or in case you use other plugins, that the HTML code show <set_id="........"> and not for instance &lt;set_id etc.
5. Have fun, and drop me a comment on www.ramgad.com if you have any comments, remarks, advices, wishes or if you're just happy.2
